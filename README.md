# Python Mini Projects Collection

This repository includes a set of Python mini-projects and scripts that demonstrate proficiency in core programming principles, algorithmic logic, and console-based interaction. Below is a description of each script included in the project:

---

## 1. üÉè Card Game (jeu_de_cartes.py)
A console-based interactive card game where a human player competes against a robot dealer. It includes card shuffling, hand management, pair elimination, and turn-based logic.

### Key Features:
- Randomized deck generation and shuffling
- Game logic for distributing cards and managing turns
- Functions for eliminating card pairs
- User input handling and validation

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Procedural programming in Python
- Game logic and flow control
- List and string manipulation
- Debugging and testing in the terminal

## 2. ‚úÖ Sequence Checker (sequenceDesDeux.py)
A simple program that checks if a sequence of values includes at least one repeated value.

### Skills:
- Input parsing
- String splitting and iteration
- Boolean logic and conditionals

---

## 3. üìè Maximum Repetition Length (sequenceMax.py)
Identifies the longest sequence of repeated consecutive numbers in a list.

### Skills:
- Use of counters and conditionals
- Conversion from string to list
- Sequence analysis

---

## 4. ‚ûï Positive Number Counter (compte_pos.py)
Counts the number of positive integers in a list provided by the user.

### Skills:
- Data parsing from input
- Iteration and counting
- Basic input validation
